# ToPDE

A Python version of the code reproduction for A Two-Phase Differential Evolution for Uniform Designs in Constrained Experimental Domains, and using the A Two-dimensional Example in the paper as an example. If you want to sample data in different constrained domains, you should  modify fitness1 function in ToPDE.py.
